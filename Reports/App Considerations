Android App
For the control on the mobile phone side we will build an android app, there are a couple of options for building this app. 
We need to choose software option that can give us the capability for the user interface we need and can also send and 
receive the Bluetooth signals effectively. This gives us a couple of options.

1.	Googles android studio, this is the core android app development studio, this will give us all the options
we need in terms of user interface and Bluetooth connection and will be a mix of java and c mainly, 
so could be our best option in terms of languages we are experience with.
2.	Python, there is the option to write python scripts, but we are unsure how stable these will be with a Bluetooth 
connection or how much flexibility we will have with GUI.
3.	Web page, we could run a local web app on the phone, this would be affective but not as stable as the other two solutions.
